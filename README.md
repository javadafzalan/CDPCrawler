# CDPCrawler
a simple script used to crawl Lan Routers and switches using CDP(Cisco Discovery Protocol)
i wrote this script using latest version of netmiko/paramiko library.
in new updates of Netmiko,it uses PyATS/Genie ,Genie is not supported in Windows Platforms and you should run it in Linux versions.

to run :
apt-get update
apt-get install python3
python3 -m pip install netmiko
